    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records that meet specific conditions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Syntax**:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
    "  FROM table_name\n",
    "  WHERE condition;\n",
    "  ```\n",

    "### **1 Comparison Operators**\n",
    "\n",
    "`WHERE` can be used with comparison operators to filter data based on conditions.\n",

    "- **Common Comparison Operators**:\n",
    "  - `=` : Equal to\n",
    "  - `!=` or `<>` : Not equal to\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: The `IN` operator allows you to specify multiple possible values for a column.\n",

    "- **Syntax**:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",

    "### **4 Using the `BETWEEN` Operator**\n",

    "- **Purpose**: The `BETWEEN` operator is used to filter the result set within a certain range. It can work with numbers, dates, or even text (alphabetical ranges).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Syntax**:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
