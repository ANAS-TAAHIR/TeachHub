    "### Lesson on Joins in MySQL\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are Joins?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **JOIN** in SQL is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Joins allow you to retrieve data from multiple tables as if they were a single table. There are several types of joins, each serving a different purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **INNER JOIN**  \n",
    "   Retrieves records that have matching values in both tables.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**  \n",
    "   Retrieves all records from the left table and matched records from the right table. If no match exists, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**  \n",
    "   Retrieves all records from the right table and matched records from the left table. If no match exists, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **FULL OUTER JOIN**  \n",
    "   Retrieves all records when there is a match in either left or right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for the table without a match. Note: MySQL does not directly support FULL OUTER JOIN, but it can be simulated with a combination of LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN using UNION.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **CROSS JOIN**  \n",
    "   Produces the Cartesian product of the two tables. Each row from the first table is combined with each row from the second table.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **SELF JOIN**  \n",
    "   Joins a table to itself to compare rows within the same table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Example Database and Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a database named `School` with two tables: `Students` and `Courses`. These will help us demonstrate the different types of joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Create Database and Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE DATABASE School;\n",
    "USE School;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Create Students table\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Students (\n",
    "    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    student_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    course_id INT\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Create Courses table\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Courses (\n",
    "    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    course_name VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Insert Sample Data\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Insert data into Students table\n",
    "INSERT INTO Students (student_id, student_name, course_id) VALUES\n",
    "(1, 'Alice', 101),\n",
    "(2, 'Bob', 102),\n",
    "(3, 'Charlie', 103),\n",
    "(4, 'David', NULL),\n",
    "(5, 'Eve', 101);\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Insert data into Courses table\n",
    "INSERT INTO Courses (course_id, course_name) VALUES\n",
    "(101, 'Mathematics'),\n",
    "(102, 'Physics'),\n",
    "(103, 'Chemistry'),\n",
    "(104, 'Biology');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can demonstrate each type of join with this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demonstrating Different Types of Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **INNER JOIN**  \n",
    "   This will return only the students who are enrolled in a course (where `course_id` matches in both tables).\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT Students.student_name, Courses.course_name\n",
    "FROM Students\n",
    "INNER JOIN Courses ON Students.course_id = Courses.course_id;\n",
    "```\n",

    "2. **LEFT JOIN**  \n",
