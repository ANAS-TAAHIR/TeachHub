    "## 1. Primary Key\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Primary Key?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Primary Key** is a field (or combination of fields) in a table that uniquely identifies each record in that table. This key ensures that no two records can have the same value in the primary key field(s). The main features of a primary key are:\n",
    "- **Uniqueness**: No duplicate values are allowed.\n",
    "- **Non-NULL**: Every record must have a value in the primary key field.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need a Primary Key?\n",
    "\n",
    "- To uniquely identify each record in the table.\n",
    "- To enforce integrity by ensuring each record is unique.\n",
    "- To improve the speed of data retrieval (Indexing).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Define a Primary Key?\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a table, you can define the primary key like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
    "  column_name1 datatype constraints,\n",
    "  column_name2 datatype constraints,\n",
    "  PRIMARY KEY (column_name1)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "OR\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
    "  column_name1 datatype constraints PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "  column_name2 datatype constraints\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to add a primary key to an existing table, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY (column_name);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE students (\n",
    "  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,\n",
    "  name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "  age INT,\n",
    "  PRIMARY KEY (id)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example ensures that each student has a unique `id`, and no two students will share the same `id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Foreign Key\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Foreign Key?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Foreign Key** is a field (or combination of fields) in one table that refers to the **Primary Key** in another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables. The foreign key enforces referential integrity, meaning it ensures that the values in the foreign key column must correspond to existing values in the primary key column of the other table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need a Foreign Key?\n",
    "\n",
    "- To maintain **referential integrity** between two related tables.\n",
    "- To prevent invalid data from being inserted in a table (e.g., if a foreign key references a non-existing record).\n",
    "- To define relationships between tables (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Define a Foreign Key?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define a foreign key at the time of table creation or by altering an existing table.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a table, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
    "  column_name1 datatype constraints,\n",
    "  column_name2 datatype constraints,\n",
    "  FOREIGN KEY (column_name2) REFERENCES other_table(column_name1)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a foreign key to an existing table, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE table_name ADD FOREIGN KEY (column_name) REFERENCES other_table(column_name);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "  order_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,\n",
    "  product_id INT,\n",
    "  quantity INT,\n",
    "  PRIMARY KEY (order_id),\n",
    "  FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `product_id` in the `orders` table is a foreign key that references the `id` column in the `products` table. This means every `product_id` in the `orders` table must exist in the `products` table.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Adding a Primary Key\n",
    "\n",
    "If a table doesnâ€™t have a primary key, you can add one using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY (column_name);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dropping a Primary Key\n",
    "\n",
    "To drop a primary key, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE table_name DROP PRIMARY KEY;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding a Foreign Key\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a foreign key to an existing table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE table_name ADD FOREIGN KEY (column_name) REFERENCES other_table(column_name);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dropping a Foreign Key\n",
    "\n",
    "To drop a foreign key, you need the **constraint_name**. You can find it using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SHOW CREATE TABLE table_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the constraint name, drop the foreign key like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE table_name DROP FOREIGN KEY constraint_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding a Primary Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE customers ADD PRIMARY KEY (customer_id);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding a Foreign Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE orders ADD FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dropping a Foreign Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE orders DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_customer_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "By using **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**, we can enforce data integrity and create relationships between different tables in a database. These keys are essential for maintaining a well-structured and reliable database system.\n",
