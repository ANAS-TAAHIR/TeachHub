    "### 1. Introduction to Stored Procedures in MySQL\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Are Stored Procedures?\n",
    "Stored Procedures in MySQL are SQL code blocks that perform a series of operations and can be executed with a single call. They are created and stored in the database, allowing users to execute complex SQL commands in a structured, reusable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Use Stored Procedures?\n",
    "Stored Procedures offer several benefits:\n",
    "1. **Modularity and Reusability**: Procedures are stored in the database and can be called as needed, simplifying complex queries.\n",
    "2. **Performance Optimization**: Stored procedures are precompiled, which can improve performance in complex operations.\n",
    "3. **Centralized Business Logic**: Logic is contained within the database, ensuring consistency across applications.\n",
    "4. **Enhanced Security**: Procedures can limit data access by providing controlled data views.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Differences Between Stored Procedures and Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature                   | **Stored Procedures**                                             | **Functions**                                  |\n",
    "|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Purpose**               | Executes a series of SQL commands. Typically used for operations that affect multiple rows or tables. | Designed to perform a single operation, like a calculation. |\n",
    "| **Return Value**          | Can return zero or more results using `OUT` parameters but doesn’t directly return a value. | Must return a single value directly.            |\n",
    "| **Calling Context**       | Called with `CALL procedure_name(...)` and doesn’t allow direct use in SQL expressions. | Can be called directly within SQL expressions, `SELECT`, `WHERE`, etc. |\n",
    "| **DML Operations**        | Supports Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) freely. | Limited in DML operations, primarily read-only operations. |\n",
    "| **Complexity**            | Typically more complex, allowing transactions, loops, and error handling. | More straightforward, typically used for calculations. |\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. Basic Syntax of a Stored Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a stored procedure in MySQL, use the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELIMITER //\n",
    "CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name (IN | OUT | INOUT parameter_name datatype, ...)\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    -- Declare local variables (optional)\n",
    "    DECLARE variable_name datatype DEFAULT default_value;\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Procedure logic\n",
    "    -- SQL Statements like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- You can use RETURN here for stored procedures\n",
    "END //\n",
    "DELIMITER ;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components of the Syntax\n",
    "Let’s go through each part of the stored procedure syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`DELIMITER`**:\n",
    "   - The default MySQL delimiter (`;`) conflicts with multiple SQL statements in stored procedures, so we temporarily change it (e.g., to `//`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`CREATE PROCEDURE`**:\n",
    "   - Starts the definition of a stored procedure.\n",
    "   - **Procedure Name**: Should be unique and descriptive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Parameters**:\n",
    "   - Stored procedures can accept parameters of three types:\n",
    "     - **IN**: Input parameters that pass data to the procedure.\n",
    "     - **OUT**: Output parameters that return data from the procedure.\n",
    "     - **INOUT**: Can both accept and return data.\n",
    "   - Each parameter requires a **name** and **datatype**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Procedure Body (BEGIN and END)**:\n",
    "   - All SQL commands and logic are encapsulated in a `BEGIN ... END` block.\n",
    "   - Here, we write the logic, including variable declarations, SQL operations, and control-flow constructs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`DECLARE`**:\n",
    "   - Used to define local variables, only accessible within the procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Control Flow and DML Operations**:\n",
    "   - Stored procedures allow `IF`, `LOOP`, `WHILE`, and `CASE` statements for control flow.\n",
    "   - Can perform DML operations like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Creating a Database: Library Management System\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll use our **Library Management System** example with the following tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Books**: Information about books in the library.\n",
    "2. **Members**: Library members’ details.\n",
    "3. **BorrowRecords**: Records of books borrowed and returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Database Schema and Sample Data\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",

    "#### Practical Usage Scenarios\n",
    "1. **Batch Inserts or Updates**: Insert or update data in batches or bulk operations.\n",

    "#### Best Practices for Writing Stored Procedures\n",
    "1. **Modularize Code**: Keep each procedure focused on a single task.\n",
    "2. **Use Comments**: Document each step for future maintainers.\n",
    "3. **Handle NULL Values**: Account for NULL inputs to avoid unexpected behavior.\n",
    "4. **Avoid Overusing Complex Logic**: Delegate heavy computations to the application layer if needed, especially with loops or nested queries.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Stored Procedures in MySQL allow for modular, reusable, and optimized database logic that can simplify complex operations. Unlike functions, stored procedures can perform a series of operations, accept `OUT` parameters\n",
    "\n",
