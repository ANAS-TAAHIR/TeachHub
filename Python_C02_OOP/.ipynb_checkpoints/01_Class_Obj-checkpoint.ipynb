    "# Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "Welcome to our second course of **Python: Object Oriented Programming**\n",
    "In this introductory session, we'll explore the basics of this popular programming paradigm and understand why it's crucial for software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is OOP?\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of organizing code into classes and objects. The objects represent real-world entities (like cars, people, or accounts) and we enclose both data (the attributes) and behavior (the methods) associated with them into a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why OOP is useful?\n",
    "We were using Procedueral Programming till now. Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods/functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "<li>OOP is faster and easier to execute</li>  \n",
    "<li>OOP provides a clear structure for the programs</li>  \n",
    "<li>OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY \"Don't Repeat Yourself\", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug</li>  \n",
    "<li>OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time</li>  "
