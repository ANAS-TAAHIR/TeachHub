    "# Association between objects\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design and program applications. Understanding the relationships between objects is crucial in OOP, and there are three main types of relationships to focus on: \n",

    "- Aggregation\n",
    "- Composition\n",
