    "## What is Abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It refers to the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, abstraction allows us to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is Abstraction Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: By hiding complex details, abstraction makes it easier to interact with an object.\n",
    "- **Security**: It protects the internal state of the object by exposing only what is necessary.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Changes to the implementation details do not affect the code that uses the object.\n"

    "# Real-World Examples of Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Smartphone Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a smartphone. As users, we interact with the phone's interface to make calls, send messages, or browse the internet. We don't need to understand the underlying code that makes these functions work. This is an example of abstraction - we interact with the essential features while the complex details are hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: ATM Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use an ATM machine to withdraw cash, you only interact with the screen and buttons. The complex processes of checking your account balance, verifying your PIN, and dispensing cash are hidden from you. The ATM provides a simple interface for a complex process - this is abstraction in action.\n"

    "\n",
    "## Abstract Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated. It is designed to be a blueprint for other classes to inherit from. Abstract classes may contain abstract methods, which are methods that are declared but contain no implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an abstract class in Python, we use the `ABC` class from the `abc`(abstract base class) module .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract method is a method that is declared, but contains no implementation. Subclasses of the abstract class must provide an implementation for each abstract method. Abstract methods are defined using the `@abstractmethod` decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Although Python does not prevent you from writing logic inside an abstract method, it is considered a good practice to keep abstract methods empty.\n"

    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation\n",
    "**Encapsulation** is the process of bundling the data (variables) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, usually a class. It also involves restricting access to certain components, which means that the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- **Hides the internal state** of the object by making some attributes private and exposing only what is necessary through public methods.\n",
    "- **Controls access** to the data using getter and setter methods.\n",
    "- Focuses on **how** the objectâ€™s data is accessed and modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstraction\n",
    "**Abstraction** is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It allows us to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
