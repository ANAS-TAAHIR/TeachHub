    "# Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "Welcome to our new course of **Python: Object Oriented Programming**\n",
    "In this series of lessons, we'll explore the basics of this popular programming paradigm and understand why it's crucial for software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is OOP?\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of organizing code into classes and objects. The objects represent real-world entities (like cars, people, or accounts) and we enclose both data (the attributes) and behavior (the methods) associated with them into a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why OOP is useful?\n",
    "OOP is a powerful programming paradigm that helps us to:\n",
    "- **Organize code**: OOP allows us to group related data and functions into a single unit (class).\n",
    "- **Reuse code**: We can create new classes by extending existing ones, which helps us to avoid repeating code.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: OOP allows us to modify the behavior of a class (based on attributes) without changing its code, which makes the code more flexible and easier to maintain.\n",
    "- **Encapsulate code**: OOP allows us to hide the internal details of a class and only expose the necessary information to the outside world.\n",
    "- **Model real-world entities**: OOP allows us to model real-world entities in a more natural way, which makes the code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages of OOP\n",
    "- **Complexity**: OOP can be more complex than procedural programming, especially for beginners.\n",
    "- **Performance**: OOP can be slower than procedural programming, especially for low-level programming (hardware).\n",
    "- **Memory usage**: OOP can use more memory than procedural programming, especially for small programs.\n",

This way, each robot starts out with the right settings and is ready to action!  \n",

    "# Pillars of Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "There are four pillars of Object Oriented Programming. We will cover them in great detail one by one. Here is the high level overview of them:\n",
    "1. **Inheritance**: It is a mechanism where a new class is derived from an existing class. It promotes code reusability. The new class will have the properties and methods of the existing class.\n",
    "2. **Encapsulation**: It is a mechanism that restricts direct access to some of the object's components. It prevents accidental modification of data. Encapsulation is implemented by using access specifiers. It also allows to combine data and methods in a single unit.\n",
    "3. **Polymorphism**: It is a mechanism that allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions. The specific action is determined by the exact nature of the situation. It allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.\n",
    "4. **Abstraction**: It is a mechanism that shows only the necessary details and hides the unnecessary details. It helps to reduce programming complexity and effort.\n",
