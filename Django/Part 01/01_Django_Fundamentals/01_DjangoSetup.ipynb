    "## **1. What are APIs?**\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) act as a bridge that allows two applications to communicate with each other. They define methods and data formats applications can use to request and exchange information. For example, when you use a weather app, the app communicates with a server API to fetch weather data. In web development, APIs often allow the frontend to interact with the backend, enabling dynamic, real-time data exchanges.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. What is Django?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Django is a high-level Python web framework designed for rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It enables developers to build secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications. Django comes with built-in tools for database interaction, user authentication, URL routing, and more, making it an excellent choice for backend development. While Django supports frontend templating, its true strength lies in creating robust backend systems and APIs.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Django Installation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up a virtual environment is optional but considered a good practice for managing project dependencies. To install Django:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Miniconda** (if not installed):\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   curl https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe --output .\\Downloads\\Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set up a conda environment**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Instead of `django_env` you can write name of your environmnet as you like.\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   conda create -n django_env \n",
    "   conda activate django_env\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Install Django**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   After activating your environment, or if you are not using a virtual environment, just run the following command to install django.\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install django\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Verify installation**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python -m django --version\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This will confirm the installed Django version.\n",

    "\n",
    "## **4. Django Project Creation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Django projects can be created using two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standard method**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   django-admin startproject storefront\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This creates a new folder `storefront` containing the project files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Single-folder method**:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   django-admin startproject storefront .\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This creates the project in the current directory, avoiding redundancy. It is preferred when working in an IDE like VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is `django-admin`?**\n",
    "`django-admin` is a command-line utility for administrative tasks like creating projects and running the server. Once the project is set up, we use `manage.py`, which is a project-specific script for similar tasks, along with additional configuration specific to the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Starting Files in Django**:\n",
    "- **`manage.py`**: A command-line utility to manage the project (e.g., running the server, migrations).\n",
    "- **Project Folder**:\n",
    "  - **`settings.py`**: Configuration file for the whole project.\n",
    "  - **`urls.py`**: URL routing for the project.\n",
    "  - **`wsgi.py`**: For deploying the project.\n",
    "  - **`asgi.py`**: For asynchronous support.\n",
    "\n",
    "We mostly work with `settings.py`, `urls.py`, and `manage.py` during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have setup our Django project, let's move on to the next steps to understand the Django project structure and how to create \n",
